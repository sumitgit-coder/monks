*********Making Image Carousel Using Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript***********

An image carousel is a container (slideshow) of images or info that users can select by clicking a button that directs them forward or backward in the slideshow. An image carousel makes a website more interactive by enhancing the user experience.

The collection of images can be automatically changed using a timer or manually when the user clicks the displayed buttons.

Step 1 - Creating a new project
Open Visual Studio Code and make a new folder. In that folder add three files ending with the .html extension, .css extension, and .js extension for the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in which you will type the following code snippets.

Step 2 - Writing the HTML code
HTML is like our codeâ€™s skeleton, it will lay out the frame of our work onto which we shall continue modifying by using other languages.

In this step, we will define containers with our images using the <div> tags. We also define our buttons that will enable the user to move through the carousel.
  
  Step - 2 Writing the CSS code
In the CSS file, we will style our HTML. We style the containers for the images, the buttons, and the small circles (we will call them navigation circles). We will also position them in the desired places using the various CSS properties. The code below has comments for one to follow through.
  
  Step 3 - Write the JavaScript code
In this step, we will define the functions we had linked to our buttons in the HTML file. We will also include a timer so that our image carousel displays images automatically like a slideshow. Type the JavaScript code below in the JavaScript file.
